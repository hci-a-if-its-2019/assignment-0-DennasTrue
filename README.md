# Wall Of text

A wall of text is deadly for an interactive experience. It’s boring and it makes it painful to read. Readability and legibility are crucial elements of web design. Your visitors have to be able to read your text so they can understand what your business is about, what you have to offer and how your products and services can help them solve a problem.

Unfortunately, many small businesses get so caught up in overloading the user with information that they overlook how that information is presented. Consider the fact that users don’t read unless absolutely necessary. Instead they scan through the information and pick out points of interest on a web page.

But cramping too many words on a single page isn’t the only problem. There are also other things that can make sure your site text difficult to read and give your visitors a migraine:

- No headings and sub-headings that break up the text
- No bullet points to make the text easier to scan
- Poor contrast between the text colour and background
- Tiny letter size
- Using too many fonts that confuse and tire readers

# How to fix this mistake

Fortunately, there some simple things you can quickly implement yourself to improve the users’ reading experience on your website.

## Here are the most important ones:

- Break up lengthy pieces of information into digestible blocks of text using headings, sub-headings, bullets, blockquotes and paragraphs.
- Write in short paragraphs
- Use a simple writing style
- Limit yourself to a maximum of three fonts
- Again, don’t forget about white space
- Highlight links, bold important keywords or phrases to provide focus points users.
 
 # Cluttered Design

 This kind of cluttered design will affect your traffic because visitors will leave your site quickly if they hate your design or if they can’t figure out what you sell or what action they’re supposed to take next.

Not only does a cluttered design drive visitors away but chances they won’t return any time soon. A high bounce rate (the percentage of visitors who leave your site after only viewing one page) can also lead to lower rankings. You surely don’t want that to happen as it can make it more difficult for potential customers to find your site within the search engine results when searching for your business.
## How to fix this mistake


- Challenge every single item on each page on your site. Simply ask yourself: “Does this really need to be here? Does it serve a purpose? Can I live without it?” Remove unnecessary elements, whether it’s an image, a video or an extra call to action that might distract visitors from taking the action you want them to take.
- Differentiate between areas of content, ads and promotions. You want visitors to find what they’re looking for quickly. If you’re trying to get too many elements to grab their attention, none actually will.
- Don’t forget about the importance of whitespace. This refers to areas of your site that are clear of content. The goal of white space is to focus the visitor’s attention to what’s really important, like a buy now button or a registration form that you’d like them fill out. This article has some great information and examples on white space so make sure you read it.
